# Payroll-Management-System
Payroll  Management System is a software program that enables your business to handle all your employee’s financial records in a hassle-free, automated fashion. This includes the employee’s salaries, bonuses, deductions, net pay and generation of pay slips for a specific period. It not only helps you attract prospective candidates but also helps in employee retention. An employee will only stick to a company if they take rewards and recognition seriously. Payroll plays an important role in enhancing employee experience with company benefits (Insurance, Pension, etc.) and flexible policies.


## Motivation
The reason we chose to work on this system, is to help users get a more secure, efficient and easy way for payroll management, over the rudimentary and unsecure method of doing it manually. 
It is more efficient than paying people manually, and avoids human error
Having a database makes it easier to store employee details as well as the invoices,ex-employees etc. which can be referred to as per the needs of the organization.
Hence we developed a system which helps us to tackle these issues


##Objectives
The purpose of this system is increase transparency between the organization and employee’s by maintaining a record of different operations performed for every employee. 
The employee doesn’t need any prior knowledge to operate this system and the flow of the system is very intuitive.
Every employee is treated equally, it does not allow forging and partial  benefits towards selected employees.
