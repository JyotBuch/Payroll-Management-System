# Payroll-Management-System
Payroll  Management System is a software program that enables your business to handle all your employee’s financial records in a hassle-free, automated fashion. This includes the employee’s salaries, bonuses, deductions, net pay and generation of pay slips for a specific period. It not only helps you attract prospective candidates but also helps in employee retention. An employee will only stick to a company if they take rewards and recognition seriously. Payroll plays an important role in enhancing employee experience with company benefits (Insurance, Pension, etc.) and flexible policies.
